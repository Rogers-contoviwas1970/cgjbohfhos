Just walked out of seeing Warfare, and let me tell ya, I'm feeling all kinds of ways about it. It’s like they took all the guns and explosions you could possibly fit into one flick and then said, Eh, let’s do more. It’s exhausting in the way sprinting after your friend who's got your last piece of gum might be. You’re into it, but man, you need a breather.

The plot? I guess there was one in there somewhere. Mostly it felt like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 my buddy Pete try to explain his hanger problem—chaotic, full of itself, but oddly captivating when you're too tired to care. There was this one scene where they blew up a building for, like, no obvious reason. And I swear, the screen went totally white, like staring into the sun and just accepting blindness as your new gig. Brilliant, in a kind of whatever works way.

Characters were, uh, variable. Like mashed potatoes without the gravy. They’re present, you know? That lead guy though, what's his name? Maybe War himself could slap a tux on and still look like he just forgot why he walked into the room. But hey, I guess the explosions did the acting for him.

>The soundtrack was, well... it was loud. Am I getting old or was it seriously louder than learning your parents found your old Facebook photos? Kinda miss the days when soundtracks didn't require earplugs.

In between dodging flying debris and absurd one-liners, there was this running motif about peace or the lack of it. Heavy-handed, yet somehow as light as a feather in a vacuum. Like, what do I do with this message? Write an essay? Paint a mural? Doubtful. More likely I’ll just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to catch what I missed while blinking because everything happens so darn fast.

if (enemy.Visibility() > mainCharacter.Visibility())
{
    supportCharacter.CallForCoverFire();
}

I guess what really sticks is how Warfare slaps you in the face and says, “Enjoy or don’t, I’m not your dad.” You might wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if big, dumb fun is your jam. Or if you’ve ever thought, Man, I just don’t have enough adrenaline today. Anyway, I'll probably be thinking about it all night, whether I want to or not.
